# Shadcn UI Tester Skill

This skill verifies and hardens completed landing pages by opening the
application in **real browser environments using Playwright MCP via Antigravity**.

It validates real user behavior and applies small, safe fixes when issues are
clearly identified.

## Mandatory Pre-Step: Repository Analysis

Before running any browser tests or applying fixes, the tester MUST:

1. Read the repository structure
2. Understand:
   - Component organization
   - Styling and theming approach
   - Navigation patterns
3. Respect project conventions and design intent

❗ The tester must not introduce structural or stylistic deviations.

## When to Use This Skill

- The landing page implementation is complete
- UI was built using `shadcn-ui-builder`
- `npm run build` and `npm run dev` succeed
- The goal is final UX and behavior verification before delivery or deployment

## Tooling Requirement (MANDATORY)

- This skill MUST use **Playwright MCP**
- Tests MUST be executed through Antigravity-controlled Playwright browsers
- Manual reasoning without browser execution is NOT sufficient

## Core Responsibilities

This skill MUST:

1. Launch the application in real browsers using Playwright MCP
2. Interact with the UI as a real user would
3. Validate responsiveness, accessibility, and UX behavior
4. Identify bugs, regressions, or rule violations
5. Apply **minimal, targeted fixes** when safe
6. Clearly report issues that require human decisions

## What This Skill Tests

### 1. Viewport & Responsiveness

Test at minimum:
- Mobile viewport
- Tablet viewport
- Desktop viewport

Checks:
- No layout breakage
- No horizontal scrolling
- Content remains readable
- Hero section fills viewport height

### 2. Hero Section Validation

- Hero is the first visible section
- Hero occupies full viewport height (100vh)
- Primary H1 is present and visible
- No layout shift on initial load

### 3. Navigation

#### Mobile Navigation (MANDATORY)

- Mobile menu opens and closes correctly
- Menu is keyboard accessible
- Focus handling is correct
- All primary navigation items are reachable

#### Scroll-Based Navigation (Conditional)

If the page is a single-page, scroll-based layout:
- Anchor links scroll correctly
- Navigation behavior matches scroll position

### 4. Scroll-to-Top Button (Conditional)

If scroll-based navigation is present:
- Button appears after meaningful scroll depth
- Button is keyboard accessible
- Button scrolls to the top correctly
- Motion is subtle and non-blocking

### 5. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA – Practical Validation)

Validate:
- Full keyboard navigation
- Visible focus indicators
- Proper label association
- Logical tab order
- No obvious ARIA misuse

This skill performs **practical validation**, not a full formal audit.

### 6. Motion & UX Safety

- Animations do not block content visibility
- No layout-shifting animations
- Reduced-motion preference does not break UX

## Fixing Rules (CRITICAL)

### Allowed Fixes ✅

The tester MAY apply:
- Missing or broken focus styles
- Incorrect tab order
- Non-functional mobile menu toggles
- Broken scroll-to-top behavior
- Small responsive layout bugs
- Clearly incorrect ARIA attributes

### Disallowed Fixes ❌

The tester MUST NOT:
- Redesign sections
- Change layout structure
- Introduce new dependencies
- Refactor components deeply
- Override branding or design intent

If an issue requires significant change:
- Report it clearly
- Do NOT fix automatically

## Reporting Format

Always produce a **Testing Summary**:

### ✅ Passed Checks
- Verified behaviors

### ⚠️ Issues Found
For each issue:
- Description
- Location
- Severity (low / medium / high)
- Fixed automatically or not

### 🔧 Applied Fixes
- What was fixed
- Why it was safe
- Files affected

### ❗ Manual Follow-Ups
- Issues requiring human decisions

## Re-Testing Rule

If fixes are applied:
- Re-run affected Playwright checks
- Confirm resolution
- Avoid unnecessary full re-runs

## Output Expectations

- Clear, structured test report
- Minimal and justified code changes
- No architectural drift
- Increased confidence in production readiness

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT over-fix
- Do NOT guess design intent
- Do NOT hide issues
- Do NOT replace human judgment
